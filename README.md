## Usage

This application gives users a fast and easy way to track their money. It allows them to access their budgetary information anytime with or without a data/internet connection. When the application is deployed, the site will display a scrollable list of the users transactions, and a graph with their total balance over time. In order to enter a transaction, simply enter the transaction name and amount. Then either select the "add funds" or "subtract funds" buttons. If the user is offline when the data is entered, the information will automatically update once a connection is reestablished.

## Review

This homework was fairly challenging for me for a couple of reasons. It required a lot of testing to insure that the necessary info was being cached appropriately. The syntax and boiler plate code was very unfamiliar to me, so I heavily relied on the activities as a resource. It also took me a while to remember that the manifest wasn't active when the page was online, so I tried to fix a non-existent issue where the manifest wasn't being found. However, I will say that this homework helped me to become a lot more familiar with the developer tools.
